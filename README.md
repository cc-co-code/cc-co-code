# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cecilia
Pronouns: she/her
## About me

I am from Stuttgart, Germany and I studied nutritinal science in Halle, Saxony. I have a broad spectrum of interests which is why I decided to expand my knowledge and dive into the techworld. 
## ðŸ‘€ Interests:
I like animals, feminist literature and motorbikes.

Iâ€™m currently learning how to code and I couldn't be happier about it.

Fun fact: I do love motorcycles but I don't have a licence to ride.
